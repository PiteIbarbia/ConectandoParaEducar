# Conectando para Educar

A page made for a starting fundation but for now is still missing some styles and apply responsive. Still the customers-founders of the fundations make me the necessary corrections.
It is all front end made with React, JavaScript(ES6), and tailwindcss for styles. Also is deploy with heroku.
